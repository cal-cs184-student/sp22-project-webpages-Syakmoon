    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

    <p>In this part, we mainly implemented the glass model. We first implemented the reflection, which is simply done by taking the opposite (negative) z, and the opposite of the entire ray. We also used Snell's law to implement refraction, and there is no refraction if it is total internal reflection. We also sample the glass by computing Fresnel coefficient and either reflect or refract based on it, but this is done by using Schlick's approximation since this is easier. Schlick's approximation gives a probability R and if coin_flip(R), we think this is a reflection, else refraction. If total internal reflection, as mentioned before, will only be a reflection.</p>

    <p>When max_ray_depth = 0, we can only see the light source, since there is no bounce.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 1, we can see the walls reflect the light. Also, the two spheres reflect only the light source. Since there is only one bounce, the spheres can not reflect the walls.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 2, we can now see the reflection on the spheres. Since refraction requires light source -> wall -> sphere surface -> sphere’s inside to reach a surface to be seen by the camera, which requires 3 layers, we cannot see the refraction to the walls with max_ray_depth = 2. Also we cannot see the ceiling in the back sphere because that requires a procedure of light source -> wall -> ceiling -> sphere surface.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 3, as what is stated above, we can now see the refraction to the walls. Also, the light source’s rays now can go through the front sphere to be refracted and become a light spot on the ground.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 4, with one more depth of ray, we can now also see the refraction of the front sphere in the reflection of the back sphere, since this requires one more bounce. We are now able to see the light spot on the wall, which is rays from the reflection of the back sphere refracted by the front sphere. Also, lights being reflected by the walls and spheres are brighter, since there are more indirect lights.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 5, it becomes brighter on almost every surface since there are more indirect lights. But there is no significant difference.</p>
    <p>When max_ray_depth = 100, the image is now brighter and more realistic, but still no significant difference.</p>

    <p>Below are images rendered from <b>CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae</b> with alpha set to 0.005, 0.05, 
    0.25, 0.5:</p>

    <p>
      By these images, we can see that when the roughness (alpha value) is set to low values, the 
      surface of the object is very glossy and has black region. But, as the roughness becomes larger, the surface becomes 
      increasingly diffuse. When the alpha is 0.5, we actually cannot see black regions on the surface of dragon.

      Below are two images rendered from <b>CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae</b> using cosine hemisphere sampling
      and importance sampling:
    </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="img/CBbunny_microfacet_cu_hemi_sample.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
          <figcaption align="middle">Cosine Hemisphere Sampling</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="img/CBbunny_microfacet_cu_importance_sample.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
          <figcaption align="middle">Importance Sampling</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    By comparing the two images, we can see that when using cosine hemisphere sampling, the image is 
    apparently noisier than the image using importance sampling. And with cosine hemisphere sampling, 
    there are a lot of black spots on the bunny, while the object in the image using importance sampling
    does not have these black spots.

    such that they correspond to material Titanium.
